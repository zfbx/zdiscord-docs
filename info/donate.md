# Donate

zdiscord has been a major undertaking and in all it's years being around and all the free support given, you've never been forced to pay money for this resource. If you like this resource and want me to continue to work on it at the same or better quality and continue to be free, please show your appreciation with a donation or subscribe to my Patreon for a couple dollars a month.&#x20;

It's quite clear the value of this resource far exceeds it's price tag (free) as I've been reminded over and over again by people who enjoy it and say things like "I can't believe a resource this good is free" or "I'd pay a subscription to use this". It's sweet and all to hear compliments like that but when nobody actually ends up donating after saying that it cuts deep and really makes me reconsider the price tag... Anyone who's used zdiscord has probably saved themselves loads of time and energy with all the utility features it gives you. If you have the means to and have benefited from all the work I've done, send over a donation ðŸ¥°
